This repository contains cryptography and crypto-utilsity functions.  

#### **random.h**  

This file includes the function `GenerateCryptographicallySecureRandomNumber`, which generates random bytes using the system's source of randomness. The randomness entirely depends on the machine.  

Currently supported platforms are **Linux** and **Apple**. The entropy level of this random number generator depends on the machine; if the machine has high entropy, the generated bytes will also have high entropy.  

On **Linux** and **Apple**, `/dev/urandom` is assumed to be cryptographically secure and is widely used in the industry for cryptographic purposes.  

##### **Usage:**  
To use this function, include `crypto-utils/random.h`.  

```cpp
#include "crypto-utils/random.h"

size_t num_bytes = 16;  
std::vector<unsigned char> random_bytes = GenerateCryptographicallySecureRandomNumber(num_bytes);
```

The function `GenerateCryptographicallySecureRandomNumber` takes a single parameter of type `size_t`, which specifies the number of random bytes to generate.  

It returns a `std::vector<unsigned char>` containing the generated random numbers.

### **hex.h**  

This file contains two functions:  

- `to_hex`: Takes a `std::vector<unsigned char>` and returns its hexadecimal string representation.  
- `from_hex`: Takes a hexadecimal string and converts it into a `std::vector<unsigned char>`.  

##### **Usage:**  
To use these functions, include `crypto-utils/hex.h`.  

```cpp
#include "crypto-utils/hex.h"

std::string msg("hi");
std::vector<unsigned char> data(msg.begin(), message.end());  
std::string hex_string = to_hex(data);  

std::vector<unsigned char> decoded_data = from_hex(hex_string);  
```
